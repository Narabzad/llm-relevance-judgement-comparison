# Perference judgments (with gpt-4o) 

These judgments are based on a sampling method for human preference decribed in Charles L. A. Clarke, Alexandra Vtyurina, and Mark D. Smucker. *Assessing top-k preferences*. ACM Transactions on Information Systems. 2021. See: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11682 adn https://github.com/claclark/preferences

The preference script (`pref.py`) was employed exactly as described in that repo except that GPT-4o was useed in place of human judgements (`judge.py`).

Output files from the preference judgment process are found in:
- DL2019 - Full judgments for TREC Deep Learning 2019
- DL2020 - Full judgments for TREC Deep Learning 2020
- DL2021 - Full judgments for TREC Deep Learning 2021
- ANTIQUE - One round of judgments for the ANTIQUE collections.
We conducted only one round for ANTIQUE
