Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
After age 30, bone resorption slowly begins to exceed new bone formation. This leads to bone loss. Bone loss in women occurs fastest in the first few years after menopause, but bone loss continues into old age.
Passage 2:
After age 30, the rate at which your bone tissue dissolves and is absorbed by the body slowly increases, while the rate of bone building decreases. So overall you lose a small amount of bone each year after age 30.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
This causes bones to lose minerals, heaviness (mass), and structure, making them weaker and more prone to breaking, leading to osteopenia. All people begin losing bone mass after they reach peak BMD at about 30 years of age. The thicker your bones are by about age 30, the longer it takes to develop osteopenia or osteoporosis.
Passage 2:
You begin to lose bone after the age of 30 and the loss speeds up after menopause. In fact, women lose up to 2% of their bone density each decade after menopause. It’s a gradual but relentless process.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
During your childhood and teenage years, your body adds new bone faster than it gets rid of old bone. After about age 30, you can start to lose bone faster than your body makes bone, which makes your bones weaker and more likely to break. Some bone loss is natural as both men and women age.
Passage 2:
Age. Our bones increase in density and strength until we reach our late 20s. Around the age of 35 we start to lose bone density as part of the natural ageing process. This happens gradually over time but is much more significant after the menopause. A large reduction in bone density is known as osteoporosis.

Bones not only get longer and wider, they also get denser (thicker). People reach their peak bone mass—their largest and densest bone— by their late teens or early twenties. As early as age 30, some bones begin to slowly lose mass as a normal part of aging.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
After age 30, bone resorption slowly begins to exceed new bone formation. This leads to bone loss. Bone loss in women occurs fastest in the first few years after menopause, but bone loss continues into old age.
Passage 2:
After about age 30, you can start to lose bone faster than your body makes it, which can weaken the bones and increase the risk of breakage. Some bone loss is natural as men and women age, but women are at higher risk of significant bone loss.

At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
Age. Our bones increase in density and strength until we reach our late 20s. Around the age of 35 we start to lose bone density as part of the natural ageing process. This happens gradually over time but is much more significant after the menopause. A large reduction in bone density is known as osteoporosis.

During your childhood and teenage years, your body adds new bone faster than it gets rid of old bone. After about age 30, you can start to lose bone faster than your body makes bone, which makes your bones weaker and more likely to break. Some bone loss is natural as both men and women age.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
Bones not only get longer and wider, they also get denser (thicker). People reach their peak bone mass—their largest and densest bone— by their late teens or early twenties. As early as age 30, some bones begin to slowly lose mass as a normal part of aging.
Passage 2:
After age 30, bone resorption slowly begins to exceed new bone formation. This leads to bone loss. Bone loss in women occurs fastest in the first few years after menopause, but bone loss continues into old age.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
After age 30, the rate at which your bone tissue dissolves and is absorbed by the body slowly increases, while the rate of bone building decreases. So overall you lose a small amount of bone each year after age 30.
Passage 2:
In adults, this can take ten years. Until our mid-20s, bone density is still increasing. But at 35 bone loss begins as part of the natural ageing process. This becomes more rapid in post-menopausal women and can cause the bone-thinning condition osteoporosis.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
You begin to lose bone after the age of 30 and the loss speeds up after menopause. In fact, women lose up to 2% of their bone density each decade after menopause. It’s a gradual but relentless process.
Passage 2:
Age. Our bones increase in density and strength until we reach our late 20s. Around the age of 35 we start to lose bone density as part of the natural ageing process. This happens gradually over time but is much more significant after the menopause. A large reduction in bone density is known as osteoporosis.

Passage 2:
During your childhood and teenage years, your body adds new bone faster than it gets rid of old bone. After about age 30, you can start to lose bone faster than your body makes bone, which makes your bones weaker and more likely to break. Some bone loss is natural as both men and women age.

Question:
does light intensity or concentration of carbon dioxide have a higher rate of photosynthesis
Passage 1:
If the concentration of CO 2 is raised still further, the rate of photosynthesis does not increase since light is now the limiting factor. When the light intensity is increased, then a higher concentration of CO 2 will be decomposed and the rate of photosynthesis increases till light again becomes a limiting factor.
Passage 2:
Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly, even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide. Increasing the light intensity will boost the speed of photosynthesis. Sometimes photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air.

Question:
does light intensity or concentration of carbon dioxide have a higher rate of photosynthesis
Passage 1:
Light intensity. Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly - even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide and a suitable temperature. Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor – a limiting factor – becomes in short supply. previous.
Passage 2:
Light. As light intensity increases so too does the rate of photosynthesis until a certain point where the graph levels off. At lower light intensities, light is the limiting factor because an increase in light causes an increase in photosynthesis.

Question:
does light intensity or concentration of carbon dioxide have a higher rate of photosynthesis
Passage 1:
If the concentration of CO 2 is raised still further, the rate of photosynthesis does not increase since light is now the limiting factor. When the light intensity is increased, then a higher concentration of CO 2 will be decomposed and the rate of photosynthesis increases till light again becomes a limiting factor.
Passage 2:
Further increase in the supply of carbon dioxide will have no effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Thus light has now become the limiting factor. Rate of photosynthesis can increase only if light intensity is increased.

Question:
does light intensity or concentration of carbon dioxide have a higher rate of photosynthesis
Passage 1:
Light. As light intensity increases so too does the rate of photosynthesis until a certain point where the graph levels off. At lower light intensities, light is the limiting factor because an increase in light causes an increase in photosynthesis.
Passage 2:
Further increase in the supply of carbon dioxide will have no effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Thus light has now become the limiting factor. Rate of photosynthesis can increase only if light intensity is increased.

Passage 1:
Multiple Intelligences. The theory of multiple intelligences was developed in 1983 by Dr. Howard Gardner, professor of education at Harvard University. It suggests that the traditional notion of intelligence, based on I.Q. testing, is far too limited.
Passage 2:
Background. Gardner, a developmental psychologist and Harvard University education professor, decades ago developed a theory that intelligence can be measured in many ways other than simple IQ tests. In his seminal 1983 book, Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences and his update, Multiple Intelligences: New Horizons, Gardner laid out the theory that paper-and-pencil IQ tests are not the best ways to measure intelligence, which can include spatial, interpersonal, existential, musical and, of course, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.

Early detection and appropriate management can then be provided and may improve a baby's outcome. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends pulse oximetry be performed at all newborn screenings to detect CCHD. As of 2018, policies for screening newborns have been implemented in all states in the U.S.
Passage 2:
Adding this screening to the required list of examinations by birthing facilities has the potential to save more newborn lives. It is heartbreaking when a parent loses their child to a condition that could have been easily detected and appropriately treated, Governor Cuomo said. This law will prevent the number one cause of infant death due to birth defects by requiring hospitals and clinics to screen newborns for congenital heart defects increasing early detection of this condition so that we can take quick action to save the lives of our children.

It is heartbreaking when a parent loses their child to a condition that could have been easily detected and appropriately treated, Governor Cuomo said. This law will prevent the number one cause of infant death due to birth defects by requiring hospitals and clinics to screen newborns for congenital heart defects increasing early detection of this condition so that we can take quick action to save the lives of our children.
Passage 2:
Early detection and appropriate management can then be provided and may improve a baby's outcome. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends pulse oximetry be performed at all newborn screenings to detect CCHD. As of 2018, policies for screening newborns have been implemented in all states in the U.S.

Question:
is pulse ox screening for children law?
Passage 1:
Babies are dying every day from undetected heart defects, but we have the knowledge and power to prevent CCHD from taking their lives so soon. Knowing that New York State has mandated a law requiring the 'pulse ox' test to be added to newborn screening means saving lives and spreading awareness. It means hope.
Passage 2:
However, some babies are born appearing healthy and without symptoms who may have serious critical congenital heart diseases. These infants will need surgery or intervention within the first year of life. In 2014 Ohio implemented universal newborn screening for critical congenital heart diseases. Legislation and administrative rules, Ohio Revised Code 3701-5010 and Ohio Administrative Code 3701-54-03, require all newborns to be screened for CCHD using pulse oximetry prior to hospital discharge, and for hospitals to report the screening results to the Ohio Department of Health.

Question:
was friedrich nietzsche an atheist
Passage 1:
Nietzsche was an atheist for his adult life and didn’t mean that there was a God who had actually died, rather that our idea of one had. After the Enlightenment , the idea of a universe that was governed by physical laws and not by divine providence was now reality.
Passage 2:
Nevertheless, Nietzsche endorsed the words. “God is dead” is often mistaken as a statement of atheism. It is not, though Nietzsche himself was an atheist. “Dead” is metaphorical in this context, meaning belief in the God of Christianity is worn out, past its prime, and on the decline.

Methylmalonic acid test. The methylmalonic acid blood test measures the amount of methylmalonic acid in the blood. The methylmalonic acid test may be used to help diagnose an early or mild vitamin B12 deficiency. It may be ordered by itself or along with a homocysteine test as a follow-up to a vitamin B12 test result that is in the lower end of the normal range.
Passage 2:
This test measures the amount of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in your blood or urine. MMA is a substance made in small amounts during metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how your body changes food into energy. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in metabolism. If your body doesn't have enough vitamin B12, it will make extra amounts of MMA.

Question:
what is the methylmalon a. c test
Passage 1:
Measurement of methylmalonic acid through the methylmalonic acid test can provide your doctor with information about an existing vitamin deficiency, especially if the B-12 deficiency is mild or just beginning. The methylmalonic acid test is more sensitive than the vitamin B-12 test. As a result, it’s better able to identify vitamin B-12 deficiencies at the lower end of the normal range.
Passage 2:
This test measures the amount of a substance called methylmalonic acid (MMA) in your  blood. MMA is typically made in tiny amounts when you digest protein. Your body makes large  amounts of MMA if you have a drop in the amount of vitamin B-12. MMA is excreted through  your kidneys.

Passage 2:
MMA Test – Urine Test. Presently, the simplest way to detect a vitamin B12 deficiency is the methylmalonic acid (MMA) test. When there is a deficiency of biologically active B12 in the cells, an increasing amount of MMA is formed, which can be measured in both the blood and urine. An advantage of measuring MMA is that it can determine very early on whether there is enough active B12 in the cells.

what is the methylmalon a. c test
Passage 1:
This test measures the amount of a substance called methylmalonic acid (MMA) in your  blood. MMA is typically made in tiny amounts when you digest protein. Your body makes large  amounts of MMA if you have a drop in the amount of vitamin B-12. MMA is excreted through  your kidneys.
Passage 2:
MMA Test – Urine Test. Presently, the simplest way to detect a vitamin B12 deficiency is the methylmalonic acid (MMA) test. When there is a deficiency of biologically active B12 in the cells, an increasing amount of MMA is formed, which can be measured in both the blood and urine. An advantage of measuring MMA is that it can determine very early on whether there is enough active B12 in the cells.

Question:
what is the methylmalon a. c test
Passage 1:
This test measures the amount of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in your blood or urine. MMA is a substance made in small amounts during metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how your body changes food into energy. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in metabolism. If your body doesn't have enough vitamin B12, it will make extra amounts of MMA.
Passage 2:
Measurement of methylmalonic acid through the methylmalonic acid test can provide your doctor with information about an existing vitamin deficiency, especially if the B-12 deficiency is mild or just beginning. The methylmalonic acid test is more sensitive than the vitamin B-12 test. As a result, it’s better able to identify vitamin B-12 deficiencies at the lower end of the normal range.

Question:
when is the best time to do a home pregnancy urine test
Passage 1:
Test Basics. To get the most reliable results from your home pregnancy test, the Mayo Clinic suggests using it a week after you miss your period when levels of hCG can be detected. Take the test when you get up in the morning, when your urine is highly concentrated — before you drink any fluids.
Passage 2:
What about an at-home urine test? The best time to take an at-home pregnancy test is first thing in the morning and with your first morning urine. This is when the urine is most concentrated and has the highest level of the pregnancy hormone hCG.

Question:
which cerebral lobe of the brain is involved in our ability to see?
Passage 1:
The occipital lobe is the smallest of four lobes, and is located at the rear of the brain. It contains the visual cortex, and is responsible for visual processing. The parietal lobe is located above the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe.
Passage 2:
The occipital lobe is at the very back of the   brain. It is most important for seeing, and  contains an area called the primary visual  cortex. People can become blind because of  damage to the occipital lobe of the brain, even  if there is nothing wrong with their eyes. 6.

which part of the life cycle is dominant in bryophyte?
Passage 1:
The way in which the alternation of generations occurs in plants depends on the type of plant. In bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), the dominant generation is haploid, so that the gametophyte comprises what we think of as the main plant.
Passage 2:
In Bryophytes, the gameophyte is the dominant, recognizable stage of life cycle and is the stage that carries out most of the plant's photosynthesis. ﻿. Chapter 22-3 Ferns, Lifecycle Diagram & #1-3.

Question:
which part of the life cycle is dominant in bryophyte?
Passage 1:
In all Bryophytes the gametophyte generation is dominant. In all other land plants the sporophyte generation is dominant. It is customary to place the dominant generation in the top half of the life cycle diagram. The figure given above summarises the life cycle of a typical Bryophyte.
Passage 2:
The haploid stage, in which a multicellular haploid gametophyte develops from a spore and produces haploid gametes, is the dominant stage in the bryophyte life cycle. This stands in direct contrast to the tracheophyte life cycle, in which the diploid stage is dominant.

Question:
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?
Passage 1:
Convergent boundaries: where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. Transform boundaries: where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other. Plate boundary zones: broad belts in which boundaries are not well defined and the effects of plate interaction are unclear.
Passage 2:
Finally  plates can also slide past each other horizontally. This is called a  transform plate boundary. Plate movement generates stress in the rocks at plate  boundaries. The type of stress is different at each type of plate boundary.

Question:
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?
Passage 1:
A boundary at which two plates move toward each other so that one plate sinks beneath the other is a convergent boundary. And a boundary at which two plates slide sideways past each other is a transform boundary. Credits: Stephen Marshak (Essentials of Geology) at February 10, 2016.
Passage 2:
Transform boundaries. At transform boundaries, two plates slide against each other as they move past in different directions. As they slide past each other, neither one is destroyed or pushed. The movement causes energy to build up, which may be released as earthquakes.

Question:
which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?
Passage 1:
Finally  plates can also slide past each other horizontally. This is called a  transform plate boundary. Plate movement generates stress in the rocks at plate  boundaries. The type of stress is different at each type of plate boundary.
Passage 2:
In some places, two plates move apart from each other; this is called a diverging plate boundary. Elsewhere two plate move together; this is a converging plate boundary. Finally plates can also slide past each other horizontally. This is called a transform plate boundary.

Question:
what is the role of t tubules
Passage 1:
T-tubules ( transverse tubules) are extensions of the cell membrane that penetrate into the centre of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. With membranes that contain large concentrations of ion channels, transporters, and pumps, T-tubules permit rapid transmission of the action potential into the cell, and also play an important role in regulating cellular calcium concentration.
Passage 2:
Action potentials in T-tubules open the voltage-gated calcium channels, which induce the calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum to open. This increases the concentration of cytosolic calcium activating muscle contraction.

Question:
what is the role of t tubules
Passage 1:
The t-tubules spread the action potential across the muscle cell and down into it. Once the action potential travels down the t-tubule it stimulates the terminal cisternae to release calcium ions which bind to the the troponin which changes shape moving the tropomyosin away from the myosin binding sites on the actin.
Passage 2:
The functions of T-tubules include rapidly transmitting electrical impulses known as action potentialsfrom the cell surface to the cell's core, and helping to regulate the concentration of calcium within the cell in a process known as excitation-contraction coupling.

Question:
what is the role of t tubules
Passage 1:
In between two terminal cisternae is a tubular infolding called a transverse tubule (T tubule). T tubules are the pathways for action potentials to signal the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium, causing a muscle contraction. Together, two terminal cisternae and a transverse tubule form a triad.
Passage 2:
T tubule: transverse intracellular tubules invaginating from the cell membrane and surrounding the myofibrils of the T system of skeletal and cardiac muscle, serving as a pathway for the spread of electrical excitation within a muscle cell.

Question:
what does karl marx say about the nature of man
Passage 1:
Karl Marx believed humanity to be capable of producing freely and creatively, overcoming the tyranny of immediate, basic needs that characterizes the rest of the animal kingdom. Under conditions which enable free, creative production, one’s personality can be expressed in the objects one produces.
Passage 2:
Marx asserted that there is a higher need to fulfill what he referred to as the human being’s “species being.”. The species being of human beings, that makes them unique within the animal kingdom, is production, the ability to adapt the environment to their purposes rather than merely live in it.

Passage 1:
However, in the sixth Theses on Feuerbach (1845), Marx criticizes the traditional conception of human nature as a species which incarnates itself in each individual, instead arguing that human nature is formed by the totality of social relations.
Passage 2:
IN HIS Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 and elsewhere, Marx starts with a very different understanding of human nature. In this conception, we are not naturally competitive, rather, we are social creatures who cannot survive without cooperating with each other. Modern science confirms this view.

Marx believed that animals can only labor for themselves and their immediate needs. Humans on the other hand can plan and labor for others. Free production — to determine, plan, and execute a series of productive actions — is vital to our species being (human nature).
Passage 2:
If man is shaped by his surroundings, his surroundings must be made human. If man is social by nature, he will develop his true nature only in society, and the strength of his nature must be measured not by the strength of separate individuals but by the power of society. (Karl Marx)[2]

Question:
is levothyroxine likely to cause weight loss or weight gain
Passage 1:
If you are going to lose weight when you add Synthroid or levothyroxine it will only be a small amount IF the medication is right for you. What's more is that due to other mechanics in your body, the addition of T4 only medications like Synthroid and levothyroxine can actually lead to weight GAIN.
Passage 2:
A sluggish thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones; as a result your metabolism slows down -- which can easily lead to weight gain. Once you begin to take levothyroxine, your metabolism will normalize and weight loss should be easier.
