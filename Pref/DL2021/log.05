Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
After age 30, the rate at which your bone tissue dissolves and is absorbed by the body slowly increases, while the rate of bone building decreases. So overall you lose a small amount of bone each year after age 30.
Passage 2:
Age. Our bones increase in density and strength until we reach our late 20s. Around the age of 35 we start to lose bone density as part of the natural ageing process. This happens gradually over time but is much more significant after the menopause. A large reduction in bone density is known as osteoporosis.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
This causes bones to lose minerals, heaviness (mass), and structure, making them weaker and more prone to breaking, leading to osteopenia. All people begin losing bone mass after they reach peak BMD at about 30 years of age. The thicker your bones are by about age 30, the longer it takes to develop osteopenia or osteoporosis.
Passage 2:
a. All adults lose bone as they grow older, beginning between the ages of 30 and 40. b. Low calcium intakes during the growing years limits the bones' ability to attain peak bone mass. c.

After age 30, the rate at which your bone tissue dissolves and is absorbed by the body slowly increases, while the rate of bone building decreases. So overall you lose a small amount of bone each year after age 30.
Passage 2:
Bones not only get longer and wider, they also get denser (thicker). People reach their peak bone mass—their largest and densest bone— by their late teens or early twenties. As early as age 30, some bones begin to slowly lose mass as a normal part of aging.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
This causes bones to lose minerals, heaviness (mass), and structure, making them weaker and more prone to breaking, leading to osteopenia. All people begin losing bone mass after they reach peak BMD at about 30 years of age. The thicker your bones are by about age 30, the longer it takes to develop osteopenia or osteoporosis.

Question:
At about what age do adults normally begin to lose bone mass?
Passage 1:
Age. Our bones increase in density and strength until we reach our late 20s. Around the age of 35 we start to lose bone density as part of the natural ageing process. This happens gradually over time but is much more significant after the menopause. A large reduction in bone density is known as osteoporosis.

Question:
does light intensity or concentration of carbon dioxide have a higher rate of photosynthesis
Passage 1:
Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly, even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide. Increasing the light intensity will boost the speed of photosynthesis. Sometimes photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air.
Passage 2:
Further increase in the supply of carbon dioxide will have no effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Thus light has now become the limiting factor. Rate of photosynthesis can increase only if light intensity is increased.

Further increase in the supply of carbon dioxide will have no effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Thus light has now become the limiting factor. Rate of photosynthesis can increase only if light intensity is increased.
Passage 2:
Light. As light intensity increases so too does the rate of photosynthesis until a certain point where the graph levels off. At lower light intensities, light is the limiting factor because an increase in light causes an increase in photosynthesis.

Passage 2:
Light intensity. Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly - even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide and a suitable temperature. Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor – a limiting factor – becomes in short supply. previous.

Question:
schizandra berry benefits
Passage 1:
One of the many schizandra berry benefits is to reduce stress and feelings of fatigue. A study suggests the fruit does so by reducing cortisol levels [1]. These adaptogenic benefits make schisandra effective for many types of environmental stressors. Beyond the stress relieving schisandra benefits, there are anti-inflammatory effects [2], memory and cognition enhancement [3], and can reduce symptoms of anxiety [4].
Passage 2:
Reishi powder has weight loss benefits. Schisandra Berry Powder aids the nervous system, promotes healthy skin, increases sexual energy, improves mental function, combats insomnia, promotes a healthy bowel and protects the liver. Schisandra powder is known to have anti-aging properties.

which kind of continental boundary is formed where two plates move horizontally past one another?
Passage 1:
Transform-Fault Boundaries: Transform-Fault Boundaries are where two plates are sliding horizontally past one another. These are also known as transform boundaries or more commonly as faults. Most transform faults are found on the ocean floor.
Passage 2:
Transform Fault. The third type of plate boundary is a transform fault. On a transform fault, the plates move in opposite but parallel directions along a fracture. In other words, the plates slide past one another.

what is the role of t tubules
Passage 1:
T-tubules ( transverse tubules) are extensions of the cell membrane that penetrate into the centre of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. With membranes that contain large concentrations of ion channels, transporters, and pumps, T-tubules permit rapid transmission of the action potential into the cell, and also play an important role in regulating cellular calcium concentration.

Question:
what is the role of t tubules
Passage 1:
The functions of T-tubules include rapidly transmitting electrical impulses known as action potentialsfrom the cell surface to the cell's core, and helping to regulate the concentration of calcium within the cell in a process known as excitation-contraction coupling.
Passage 2:
The purpose of t-tubules is to allow depolarization to quickly penetrate to the interior of the cell. The t-tubules help to bring the extracellular environment to all parts of the muscle cell more quickly which better coordinates muscle contraction. ...Show more.

what helps u nails grow
Passage 1:
1. Get plenty of Vitamin H (biotin). Biotin promotes the growth and strength of nails, hair, and skin. Aim to consume between 30 and 40 micrograms per day either through food or supplements. Whole grains, mushrooms, bananas, salmon, and avocado are all great sources of biotin.
Passage 2:
Multivitamins can help speed up rate of growth of your nails. Daily exercising will increase blood circulation, which will improve rate of growth of your nails. Exposing your fingers to early morning sunlight too can help a great deal, since it helps your body to create Vitamin D, which contributes to faster nail growth.

Passage 1:
However, in the sixth Theses on Feuerbach (1845), Marx criticizes the traditional conception of human nature as a species which incarnates itself in each individual, instead arguing that human nature is formed by the totality of social relations.
Passage 2:
For Marx, the essence of human nature, what singles out humans from other aspects is their capacity to control their own environment by creative activity; they can work out a conception of what they wish to create and then put this into practice. Humans express their humanity in and through work.

Question:
what does karl marx say about the nature of man
Passage 1:
However, in the sixth Theses on Feuerbach (1845), Marx criticizes the traditional conception of human nature as a species which incarnates itself in each individual, instead arguing that human nature is formed by the totality of social relations.
