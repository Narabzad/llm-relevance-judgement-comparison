Passage 1:
Medical Definition of BMT. BMT: Bone marrow transplantation, a procedure in which doctors replace bone marrow that is diseased (or damaged) with healthy bone marrow. The bone marrow to be replaced may be deliberately destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
Passage 2:
A bone marrow transplant (BMT) is also called a stem cell transplant (SCT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).The procedure replaces unhealthy blood-forming stem cells with healthy ones and offers some patients the possibility of a cure.

Low TSH Levels: What They Can Mean. Low TSH can indicate that there's an abundance of thyroid hormone being produced by the thyroid gland, so the pituitary gland sees no need to release TSH.
Passage 2:
What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.
Passage 2:
If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
A low TSH result may indicate: 1  An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) 2  Excessive amounts of thyroid hormone medication in those who are being treated for an underactive (or removed) thyroid gland.
Passage 2:
Low TSH Levels: What They Can Mean. Low TSH can indicate that there's an abundance of thyroid hormone being produced by the thyroid gland, so the pituitary gland sees no need to release TSH.

Question:
what type of tissue are bronchioles
Passage 1:
A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.

Question:
what type of tissue are bronchioles

A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.
Passage 2:
