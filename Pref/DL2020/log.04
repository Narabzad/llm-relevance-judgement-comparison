Passage 2:
Scholars think that the Etruscans were a seafaring people from Asia Minor. As early as 1000 BC they were living in Italy in an area that was roughly equivalent to modern Tuscany, from the Tiber River north almost to the Arno River. Later their rule embraced a large part of western Italy, including Rome.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
The skeletal muscles in your body are responsible for moving your bones, thus enabling you to walk, jump, lift, and move in many ways. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on a bone to cause this movement. The structure that transmits the force of the muscle contraction to the bone is called a tendon.
Passage 2:
Bodily movement is carried out by the interaction of the muscular and skeletal systems. For this reason, they are often grouped together as the musculo-skeletal system. Muscle is attached to bone by tendons and other tissues, and exerts force by converting chemical energy into tension and contraction. Skeletal muscles which cause movement of a joint are connected to two different bones and contract to pull them together.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
Bodily movement is carried out by the interaction of the muscular and skeletal systems. For this reason, they are often grouped together as the musculo-skeletal system. Muscle is attached to bone by tendons and other tissues, and exerts force by converting chemical energy into tension and contraction. Skeletal muscles which cause movement of a joint are connected to two different bones and contract to pull them together.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
Muscles provide the tug on the bones needed to bend, straighten, and support joints. Muscles can pull on bones, but they can't push them back to their original position, so the muscles work in pairs of flexors and extensors. The extensor muscle relaxes and stretches as the flexor muscle contracts to bend the joint.
Passage 2:
Vertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
How both interact: The skeletal system is covered with muscles that enable us to move. These muscles are attached to the bones through tendons and often stretch from one end of the bone to the other. Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system then sends signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone to follow.
Passage 2:
Skeletal Muscles Bodily movement is carried out by the interaction of the muscular and skeletal systems. For this reason, they are often grouped together as the musculo-skeletal system. Muscle is attached to bone by tendons and other tissues, and exerts force by converting chemical energy into tension and contraction. Skeletal muscles which cause movement of a joint are connected to two different bones and contract to pull them together.

Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, apples, pears, barley and prunes. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Five to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber a day decreases your total and LDL cholesterol. Eating 1 1/2 cups of cooked oatmeal provides 6 grams of fiber.
Passage 2:
Foods that can help lower cholesterol: Fiber (oats, legumes, berries), healthy fats (olive oil, avocados, nuts), and plant stanols or sterols (found in small amounts in vegetable oil, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and are also added to foods) have all been shown to help lower cholesterol.

Passage 1:
Oatmeal, oat bran and high-fiber foods. Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which reduces your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol. Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, apples, pears, barley and prunes. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Five to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber a day decreases your total and LDL cholesterol. Eating 1 1/2 cups of cooked oatmeal provides 6 grams of fiber. If you add fruit, such as bananas, you'll add about 4 more grams of fiber. To mix it up a little, try steel-cut oatmeal or cold cereal made with oatmeal or oat bran.
Passage 2:
Foods naturally rich in soluble fiber have proven particularly good at lowering cholesterol. Excellent sources include oats, oat bran, barley, peas, yams, sweet potatoes and other potatoes, as well as legumes or beans, such as pinto beans, black beans, garbanzo beans, and peas.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
Low TSH and high FT4 levels are usually seen in people with a condition called hyperthyroidism, the end result of an overactive thyroid gland. Low TSH levels can also indicate that the pituitary gland itself is damaged; however, this is very rare.
Passage 2:
Low TSH Levels: What They Can Mean. Low TSH can indicate that there's an abundance of thyroid hormone being produced by the thyroid gland, so the pituitary gland sees no need to release TSH.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
A low TSH result indicates that the thyroid gland is overactive, and is producing too many hormones. A high TSH result is indicative of hypothyroidism, because the thyroid is not responding properly to the pituitary gland, and thus, is not creating enough hormones.
Passage 2:
If the thyroid gland is producing too much thyroid hormone (a condition called hyperthyroidism), the pituitary gland produces less TSH in an attempt to decrease the thyroid's production of thyroid hormones.

Low TSH Levels: What They Can Mean. Low TSH can indicate that there's an abundance of thyroid hormone being produced by the thyroid gland, so the pituitary gland sees no need to release TSH.
Passage 2:
LOW TSH suggests you are closer to HYPERthyroidism (overactive), and have too much thyroid hormone circulating. HIGH TSH suggests you are closer to HYPOthyroidism (underactive), and you don't have enough thyroid hormone circulating.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone or Thyrotropin) Test - A low TSH level in the blood is the most accurate indicator of hyperthyroidism. The body shuts off production of this pituitary hormone when the thyroid gland even slightly overproduces thyroid hormone.
Passage 2:
LOW TSH suggests you are closer to HYPERthyroidism (overactive), and have too much thyroid hormone circulating. HIGH TSH suggests you are closer to HYPOthyroidism (underactive), and you don't have enough thyroid hormone circulating.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a pituitary gland hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce hormones. When thyroid hormone levels are normal or high, your TSH should be lower. An abnormally low TSH can be the first sign of hyperthyroidism.
Passage 2:
Low TSH and high FT4 levels are usually seen in people with a condition called hyperthyroidism, the end result of an overactive thyroid gland. Low TSH levels can also indicate that the pituitary gland itself is damaged; however, this is very rare.

Question:
what type of tissue are bronchioles
Passage 1:
A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.

A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.he diameter of the bronchioles plays an important role in air flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called bronchodilation and is stimulated by either epinephrine or sympathetic nerves to increase air flow.
Passage 2:
Lesson Summary. Simple cuboidal epithelium is a type of epithelial tissue found in the body. It is a single layer thick and made of cube-shaped cells. This type of tissue is found lining parts of the body such as the kidney tubules and walls of respiratory bronchioles.

Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.he diameter of the bronchioles plays an important role in air flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called bronchodilation and is stimulated by either epinephrine or sympathetic nerves to increase air flow.

Question:
what type of tissue are bronchioles
Passage 1:
Simple cuboidal epithelium is a type of epithelial tissue found in the body. It is a single layer thick and made of cube-shaped cells. This type of tissue is found lining parts of the body such as the kidney tubules and walls of respiratory bronchioles.
Passage 2:
increased airway resistance decreases airway ventilation [Bronchioles are made of smooth muscle, not cartilage, so it can contract or relax, and in asthmatics they contract (due to allergens or exercise) restricting airflow]; alveolar PO2: low arterial PO2: low.

Question:
what type of tissue are bronchioles
Passage 1:
They are histologically distinct from the tertiary bronchi in that their walls do not have hyaline cartilage and they have club cells in their epithelial lining. The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size.
Passage 2:
Next, identify a bronchiole and note: 1  simple columnar ciliated epithelium--cells shorter than in the bronchi and trachea, 2  domed secretory, non-ciliated exocrine cells (also known as club cells), 3  smooth muscle in the submucosa, and.  absence of seromucous glands and cartilage.

Passage 1:
A histogram is a bar graph that illustrates the frequency of an event occurring using the height of the bar as an indicator. A Pareto chart is a special type of histogram that represents the Pareto philosophy (the 80/20 rule) through displaying the events by order of impact.
Passage 2:
The Pareto Chart: The Pareto chart can also be known as, the Pareto diagram. There can be two types of Pareto Charts such as, a weighted Pareto chart or a comparative Pareto Chart. A Pareto chart is a special bar graph, where the lengths are represented by frequency or cost, time or money that are arranged with the longest bars on the left and the shortest to the right side.

Question:
what the best way to get clothes white
Passage 1:
What to Do. Wash whites separately.

Choose detergent with a bleach alternative and/or enzymes, using the maximum amount recommended.
Passage 2:
Hydrogen peroxide will whiten and brighten clothes, disinfect laundry, and remove stains. Pour it directly on stains such as blood. Add 1 cup of hydrogen peroxide to whites in the washing machine to brighten them. Add one cup to a load of diapers to whiten, deodorize, and disinfect.

Question:
what medium do radio waves travel through
Passage 1:
No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa â¦ ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space.
Passage 2:
Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.

Question:
what medium do radio waves travel through
Passage 1:
Electromagnetic waves are waves that can travel through a vacuum (empty space). They don't need a medium or matter. They travel through electrical and magnetic fields that are generated by charged particles. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light, microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays.
Passage 2:
Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.

Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.

Question:
what medium do radio waves travel through
Passage 1:
No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa â¦ ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space. Let's contrast that with a mechanical wave.
Passage 2:
Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel. Other examples include water waves, seismic waves, and waves traveling through a spring. Electromagnetic waves are waves that can travel through a vacuum (empty space). They don't need a medium or matter. They travel through electrical and magnetic fields that are generated by charged particles. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light, microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays.

Just as with CoQ10, the more advanced the heart disease, the lower the L-carnitine concentration present and the greater the need for it. Similarly, the more advanced the heart disease, the more responsive the patient to supplementation. L-carnitine comes from two amino acids: lysine and methionine.
Passage 2:
Nutrients for L-carnitine Production. Niacin, vitamin B-6 and iron increase metabolism by assisting with the production of L-carnitine, an amino acid that promotes fat burning, notes Vanderbilt University. Your body synthesizes L-carnitine from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine in the liver.
