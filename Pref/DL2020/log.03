If your body goes from 98.6 degrees to the temperature of a fever, it could keep the proteins from working properly and contribute to a miscarriage. In rare cases, it can cause birth defects. In some studies, fever during the first trimester has been linked to an increase in the risk of cleft palate, heart defects, and neural tube defects. These studies did not consider the underlying cause of the fevers, however, so there are questions about whether the cause for concern is the fever itself or whatever is causing the fever, such as an infection.

Passage 1:
In a bone marrow transplant, the patient's bone marrow stem cells are replaced with those from a healthy, matching donor. To do this, all of the patient's existing bone marrow and abnormal leukocytes are first killed using a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.
Passage 2:
What are bone marrow transplantation and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation? Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) are procedures that restore stem cells that have been destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Passage 1:
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) are procedures that restore stem cells that have been destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. There are three types of transplants: 1  In autologous transplants, patients receive their own stem cells.
Passage 2:
Stem cell transplant is the term commonly used to describe bone marrow transplant and transplants done with stem cells found in the blood. Stem cell transplants offer some patients the possibility of a cure, and others a longer period of disease-free survival. Your body cannot make the blood cells it needs because your bone marrow or stem cells have failed. 2  Your bone marrow or blood cells have become diseased. 3  In this case you need healthy stem cells to replace the diseased bone marrow/stem cells.

Bone marrow transplant. Overview. A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that infuses healthy blood stem cells into your body to replace your damaged or diseased bone marrow. A bone marrow transplant is also called a stem cell transplant. A bone marrow transplant may be necessary if your bone marrow stops working and doesn't produce enough healthy blood cells. Bone marrow transplants may use cells from your own body (autologous transplant) or from a donor (allogeneic transplant).
Passage 2:
The replacement marrow may be the patient's own marrow or it may come from another person. If the marrow comes from the patient. it is called an autologous bone marrow transplant. If the marrow is from an identical twin, it is termed a syngeneic transplant. And if the marrow is from a donor who is not an identical twin, the procedure is an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Most bone marrow transplants today are allogeneic. Bone marrow transplant is abbreviated BMT.

If the marrow is from an identical twin, it is termed a syngeneic transplant. And if the marrow is from a donor who is not an identical twin, the procedure is an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Most bone marrow transplants today are allogeneic. Bone marrow transplant is abbreviated BMT.

Passage 2:
Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is a special therapy for patients with certain cancers or other diseases. A bone marrow transplant involves taking cells that are normally found in the bone marrow (stem cells), filtering those cells, and giving them back either to the donor (patient) or to another person.raft failure may occur as a result of infection, recurrent disease, or if the stem cell count of the donated marrow was insufficient to cause engraftment.

Passage 1:
Bone marrow transplant. Overview. A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that infuses healthy blood stem cells into your body to replace your damaged or diseased bone marrow. A bone marrow transplant is also called a stem cell transplant. A bone marrow transplant may be necessary if your bone marrow stops working and doesn't produce enough healthy blood cells. Bone marrow transplants may use cells from your own body (autologous transplant) or from a donor (allogeneic transplant).
Passage 2:
What are bone marrow transplantation and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation? Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) are procedures that restore stem cells that have been destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. There are three types of transplants: In autologous transplants, patients receive their own stem cells.

Passage 1:
A stem cell transplant is done after chemotherapy and radiation is complete. The stem cells are delivered into your bloodstream usually through a tube called a central venous catheter. The process is similar to getting a blood transfusion.The stem cells travel through the blood into the bone marrow. bone marrow transplant is a procedure to replace damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells. Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all of your blood cells.
Passage 2:
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) are procedures that restore stem cells that have been destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. There are three types of transplants: In autologous transplants, patients receive their own stem cells.

Passage 1:
Bone marrow transplant. Overview. A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that infuses healthy blood stem cells into your body to replace your damaged or diseased bone marrow. A bone marrow transplant is also called a stem cell transplant. A bone marrow transplant may be necessary if your bone marrow stops working and doesn't produce enough healthy blood cells. Bone marrow transplants may use cells from your own body (autologous transplant) or from a donor (allogeneic transplant).
Passage 2:
A bone marrow transplant is a medical procedure used to replace diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. However, it is usually the blood stem cells that are transplanted, not the actual bone marrow. So, this procedure is more commonly called a stem cell transplant.one marrow makes than more 20 billion new blood cells every day. Bone marrow stem cells are essential because they mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body. White blood cells help the body fight infections and diseases.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
The skeleton and muscles function together as the musculoskeletal system. This system (often treated as two separate systems, the muscular, and skeletal) plays an important homeostatic role: allowing the animal to move to more favorable external conditions.ertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.
Passage 2:
Muscles provide the tug on the bones needed to bend, straighten, and support joints. Muscles can pull on bones, but they can't push them back to their original position, so the muscles work in pairs of flexors and extensors. The extensor muscle relaxes and stretches as the flexor muscle contracts to bend the joint.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
The skeletal muscles in your body are responsible for moving your bones, thus enabling you to walk, jump, lift, and move in many ways. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on a bone to cause this movement. The structure that transmits the force of the muscle contraction to the bone is called a tendon.
Passage 2:
Muscles are attached to bones by strong tendons. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on the bone, and the bone can move if it is part of a joint. Muscles can only pull and cannot push.This would be a problem if a joint was controlled by just one muscle.uscles are attached to bones by strong tendons.

Passage 1:
How both interact: The skeletal system is covered with muscles that enable us to move. These muscles are attached to the bones through tendons and often stretch from one end of the bone to the other. Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system then sends signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone to follow.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
Skeletal Muscles Bodily movement is carried out by the interaction of the muscular and skeletal systems. For this reason, they are often grouped together as the musculo-skeletal system. Muscle is attached to bone by tendons and other tissues, and exerts force by converting chemical energy into tension and contraction. Skeletal muscles which cause movement of a joint are connected to two different bones and contract to pull them together.
Passage 2:
Strands of tough connective tissue connect the skeletal muscles to bones. These strands of tissue are called tendon s. When a muscle that connects two bones gets shorter, the bones are pulled closer to each other. For example, tendons attach the biceps muscle to a bone in your shoulder and to a bone in your forearm.When the biceps muscle shortens, your forearm bends toward your shoulder. The skeletal muscles often work in pairs to produce smooth, controlled motions by pulling, or contracting.hen one muscle in the pair bends part of the body, the other muscle extends or straightens part of the body. Bones of the Chicken The upper wing consists of a humerus, which is at one end, and the ulna and the radius at the lower wing. These bones connect at the elbow joint.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
The skeletal muscles in your body are responsible for moving your bones, thus enabling you to walk, jump, lift, and move in many ways. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on a bone to cause this movement. The structure that transmits the force of the muscle contraction to the bone is called a tendon.
Passage 2:
Relationship of skeletal muscles to bones. - Muscles are attached to bones by tendons known as the origins and insertions. - Skeletal muscles produce movements by pulling on bones. - Bones serve as levers, and joints act as fulcrums for the levers. - Muscles that move a body part often do not cover the moving part.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
Bones, ligaments, and muscles are the structures that form levers in the body to create human movement. In simple terms, a joint (where two or more bones join together) forms the axis (or fulcrum), and the muscles crossing the joint apply the force to move a weight or resistance.
Passage 2:
This system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers via connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments. The bones provide stability to the body. Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones.To allow motion, different bones are connected by joints.Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other.

Passage 1:
Vertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.
Passage 2:
Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone (or bones) to follow.

The skeleton and muscles function together as the musculoskeletal system. This system (often treated as two separate systems, the muscular, and skeletal) plays an important homeostatic role: allowing the animal to move to more favorable external conditions.ertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
Bones, ligaments, and muscles are the structures that form levers in the body to create human movement. In simple terms, a joint (where two or more bones join together) forms the axis (or fulcrum), and the muscles crossing the joint apply the force to move a weight or resistance.

Passage 1:
Muscles provide the tug on the bones needed to bend, straighten, and support joints. Muscles can pull on bones, but they can't push them back to their original position, so the muscles work in pairs of flexors and extensors. The extensor muscle relaxes and stretches as the flexor muscle contracts to bend the joint.
Passage 2:
A tendon is a band of connective tissue that connects muscle to bone. The tendons and muscles work together to control joint movement.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
How both interact: The skeletal system is covered with muscles that enable us to move. These muscles are attached to the bones through tendons and often stretch from one end of the bone to the other. Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system then sends signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone to follow.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
Relationship of skeletal muscles to bones. - Muscles are attached to bones by tendons known as the origins and insertions. - Skeletal muscles produce movements by pulling on bones. - Bones serve as levers, and joints act as fulcrums for the levers. - Muscles that move a body part often do not cover the moving part.
Passage 2:
Strands of tough connective tissue connect the skeletal muscles to bones. These strands of tissue are called tendon s. When a muscle that connects two bones gets shorter, the bones are pulled closer to each other. For example, tendons attach the biceps muscle to a bone in your shoulder and to a bone in your forearm.When the biceps muscle shortens, your forearm bends toward your shoulder. The skeletal muscles often work in pairs to produce smooth, controlled motions by pulling, or contracting.hen one muscle in the pair bends part of the body, the other muscle extends or straightens part of the body. Bones of the Chicken The upper wing consists of a humerus, which is at one end, and the ulna and the radius at the lower wing. These bones connect at the elbow joint.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.
Passage 2:

Passage 1:
Skeletal Muscles Bodily movement is carried out by the interaction of the muscular and skeletal systems. For this reason, they are often grouped together as the musculo-skeletal system. Muscle is attached to bone by tendons and other tissues, and exerts force by converting chemical energy into tension and contraction. Skeletal muscles which cause movement of a joint are connected to two different bones and contract to pull them together.
Passage 2:
Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone (or bones) to follow.

Vertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.endons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.
Passage 2:
Yes. They work together, with the muscles contracting and pulling on tendons attached to bones, therefore pulling or pushing the bones to create movement. They control movement of the body together    The muscular system and the skeletal system work together to provide support and movement for the body. Your muscles are connected to your bones by a material called cartilage. Cartilage is an extremely strong material that is impossible to tear.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
This system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers via connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments. The bones provide stability to the body. Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones.To allow motion, different bones are connected by joints.Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other. Muscles contract to move the bone attached at the joint.he bones provide stability to the body. Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones. To allow motion, different bones are connected by joints. Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other.
Passage 2:
The skeletal muscles in your body are responsible for moving your bones, thus enabling you to walk, jump, lift, and move in many ways. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on a bone to cause this movement. The structure that transmits the force of the muscle contraction to the bone is called a tendon.

Question:
describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement
Passage 1:
The muscles in our bodies are attached to bones. They help the bones move, much like strings help a puppet move. But muscles can pull in only one direction. They cannot push. Each bone is usually attached to a pair of muscles.
Passage 2:
How both interact: The skeletal system is covered with muscles that enable us to move. These muscles are attached to the bones through tendons and often stretch from one end of the bone to the other. Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system then sends signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone to follow.

dog day afternoon meaning
Passage 1:
Lilies in the late July heat, Lemnos, Greece. The dog days or dog days of summer are the hot, sultry days of summer. They were historically the period following the heliacal rising of the star Sirius, which Greek and Roman astrology connected with heat, drought, sudden thunderstorms, lethargy, fever, mad dogs, and bad luck. They are now taken to be the hottest, most uncomfortable part of summer in the Northern Hemisphere.
Passage 2:
Hot, sultry summer weather; also, a period of stagnation. For example, It's hard to get much work done during the dog days, or Every winter there's a week or two of dog days when sales drop dramatically. The term alludes to the period between early July and early September, when Sirius, the so-called Dog Star, rises and sets with the sun.

Question:
how much would it cost to install my own wind turbine
Passage 1:
A 10 kW wind turbine costs approximately $48,000 â 65,000 to install. The equipment cost is about $40,000 (see 10 kW GridTek System ) and the rest is shipping and installation. Towers without guy wires are more expensive than guyed towers.
Passage 2:
Wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000-$80,000 (or more). Wind turbines have significant economies of scale.

Question:
how often to button quail lay eggs
Passage 1:
Like chickens, button quail can lay one egg a day every day, for almost her entire life. Without special attention, this practice can very quickly deplete the female of her bone calcium and other essential nutrients, leading to a very early death.
Passage 2:
Quail are most fertile and productive between the ages of 2 and 8 months, when hens usually lay one egg daily. At 9 months and beyond, fertility declines, although the average hen may still produce 200 or so eggs annually. For best results, keep one male with just two to three females.

If the quail receives the right amount of l â¦ ight, they will approx.lay 1 egg per day. On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year. I hope this answered your question.ow many eggs do quail lay at one time?   No bird can lay more than an egg every day (or just a little less than 24 hours).
Passage 2:
Quail are most fertile and productive between the ages of 2 and 8 months, when hens usually lay one egg daily. At 9 months and beyond, fertility declines, although the average hen may still produce 200 or so eggs annually. For best results, keep one male with just two to three females.

Question:
what are best foods to lower cholesterol
Passage 1:
The Mayo Clinic provides a top five list of the best foods for blood cholesterol levels. Oatmeal, fish, nuts, olive oil and foods that contain stanols, like orange juice and yogurt drinks, top the list. Although you should avoid foods that are high in saturated and trans fat, not all fat is bad for cholesterol.n fact, foods that contain monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat actually lower your bad cholesterol levels while increasing good cholesterol. Foods that promote healthy blood cholesterol levels include plant oils -- except for palm and coconut oil -- as well as fish, nuts and avocados.
Passage 2:
Soluble fibers can also help lower LDL (âbadâ) blood cholesterol by interfering with the absorption of dietary cholesterol. 1  Sources of soluble fiber: oatmeal, oat cereal, lentils, apples, oranges, pears, oat bran, strawberries, nuts, flaxseeds, beans, dried peas, blueberries, psyllium, cucumbers, celery, and carrots.

Question:
what are best foods to lower cholesterol
Passage 1:
Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which reduces your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol. Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, apples, pears, barley and prunes. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Five to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber a day decreases your total and LDL cholesterol. Eating 1 1/2 cups of cooked oatmeal provides 6 grams of fiber. If you add fruit, such as bananas, you'll add about 4 more grams of fiber. To mix it up a little, try steel-cut oatmeal or cold cereal made with oatmeal or oat bran.
Passage 2:
Foods that can help lower cholesterol. A variety of whole- and multi-grain products, such as bran and oats; Fatty fishes, such as salmon, mackerel and albacore tuna; Foods rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables; Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as avocado, flax seeds, olive oil and canola oil

Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which reduces your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol. Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, apples, pears, barley and prunes. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Five to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber a day decreases your total and LDL cholesterol. Eating 1 1/2 cups of cooked oatmeal provides 6 grams of fiber. If you add fruit, such as bananas, you'll add about 4 more grams of fiber. To mix it up a little, try steel-cut oatmeal or cold cereal made with oatmeal or oat bran.
Passage 2:
Oatmeal, oat bran and high-fiber foods. Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which reduces your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol. Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, apples, pears, barley and prunes.Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream.Five to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber a day decreases your total and LDL cholesterol.o avoid eating too many nuts and gaining weight, replace foods high in saturated fat with nuts. For example, instead of using cheese, meat or croutons in your salad, add a handful of walnuts or almonds. Avocados are a potent source of nutrients as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs).

Oatmeal, oat bran and high-fiber foods. Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which reduces your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol. Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, apples, pears, barley and prunes. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Five to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber a day decreases your total and LDL cholesterol. Eating 1 1/2 cups of cooked oatmeal provides 6 grams of fiber. If you add fruit, such as bananas, you'll add about 4 more grams of fiber.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a pituitary gland hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce hormones. When thyroid hormone levels are normal or high, your TSH should be lower. An abnormally low TSH can be the first sign of hyperthyroidism.
Passage 2:
TSH levels in your bloodstream rise or fall depending on whether there is enough thyroid hormone in your system to meet your bodyâs needs. Higher levels of TSH push the thyroid to produce more hormone. Low TSH levels mean the thyroid is producing more than enough hormone. TSH levels can change a great deal with minor increases and decreases in T4. This is a very tightly regulated feedback process between the pituitary and the thyroid gland.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
This drop in TSH is the pituitary glandâs attempt to return circulating T3 & T4 hormone levels to normal. Therefore, the TSH test results will show lower than normal TSH when the thyroid is overactive. So, in general, lower TSH levels equals an overactive thyroid; or hyperthyroidism.
Passage 2:
If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.

If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.
Passage 2:
What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, and not by the thyroid as it may seem. The purpose of TSH is to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone. High TSH levels typically indicates that the body is not receiving enough thyroid hormone. A low TSH level is indicative of the body receiving too much thyroid hormone.
Passage 2:
TSH levels in your bloodstream rise or fall depending on whether there is enough thyroid hormone in your system to meet your bodyâs needs. Higher levels of TSH push the thyroid to produce more hormone. Low TSH levels mean the thyroid is producing more than enough hormone. TSH levels can change a great deal with minor increases and decreases in T4. This is a very tightly regulated feedback process between the pituitary and the thyroid gland.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a pituitary gland hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce hormones. When thyroid hormone levels are normal or high, your TSH should be lower. An abnormally low TSH can be the first sign of hyperthyroidism.
Passage 2:
Best Answer: You may have hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. Normal TSH levels are 0.5 to 5. TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone. TSH is a chemical produced by your pituitary gland.TSH tells your thyroid to make and release the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Your T4 is high, so your pituitary has virtually stopped sending TSH to your thyroid; therefore your TSH is low.est Answer: You may have hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland.

Responses (3) Confusing I know but in general a low TSH is indicative of an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism and your thyroid hormone dose needs to be reduced. A high TSH is indicative of an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism and your medicine needs increasing.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
A low TSH result indicates that the thyroid gland is overactive, and is producing too many hormones. A high TSH result is indicative of hypothyroidism, because the thyroid is not responding properly to the pituitary gland, and thus, is not creating enough hormones.
Passage 2:
If the thyroid gland is producing too much thyroid hormone (a condition called hyperthyroidism), the pituitary gland produces less TSH in an attempt to decrease the thyroid's production of thyroid hormones.

what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, and not by the thyroid as it may seem. The purpose of TSH is to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone. High TSH levels typically indicates that the body is not receiving enough thyroid hormone. A low TSH level is indicative of the body receiving too much thyroid hormone.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
TSH levels in your bloodstream rise or fall depending on whether there is enough thyroid hormone in your system to meet your bodyâs needs. Higher levels of TSH push the thyroid to produce more hormone. Low TSH levels mean the thyroid is producing more than enough hormone. TSH levels can change a great deal with minor increases and decreases in T4. This is a very tightly regulated feedback process between the pituitary and the thyroid gland.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.
Passage 2:
LOW TSH suggests you are closer to HYPERthyroidism (overactive), and have too much thyroid hormone circulating. HIGH TSH suggests you are closer to HYPOthyroidism (underactive), and you don't have enough thyroid hormone circulating.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.
Passage 2:
Responses (3) Confusing I know but in general a low TSH is indicative of an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism and your thyroid hormone dose needs to be reduced. A high TSH is indicative of an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism and your medicine needs increasing.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
A low TSH result indicates that the thyroid gland is overactive, and is producing too many hormones. A high TSH result is indicative of hypothyroidism, because the thyroid is not responding properly to the pituitary gland, and thus, is not creating enough hormones.
Passage 2:
Best Answer: You may have hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. Normal TSH levels are 0.5 to 5. TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone. TSH is a chemical produced by your pituitary gland.TSH tells your thyroid to make and release the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Your T4 is high, so your pituitary has virtually stopped sending TSH to your thyroid; therefore your TSH is low.est Answer: You may have hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. Normal TSH levels are 0.5 to 5. TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone. TSH is a chemical produced by your pituitary gland.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels evaluate the functioning of the thyroid gland. TSH instructs the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone. High TSH levels indicate that the thyroid is underactive, and a low TSH means the thyroid is overactive. Abnormal TSH levels alert medical professionals to diseases of the thyroid gland.
Passage 2:
This drop in TSH is the pituitary glandâs attempt to return circulating T3 & T4 hormone levels to normal. Therefore, the TSH test results will show lower than normal TSH when the thyroid is overactive. So, in general, lower TSH levels equals an overactive thyroid; or hyperthyroidism.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
If the TSH is too high you have a condition called hypothyroidism, or an under-functioning thyroid gland. If itâs extremely low, you have an overactive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism.
Passage 2:
Responses (3) Confusing I know but in general a low TSH is indicative of an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism and your thyroid hormone dose needs to be reduced. A high TSH is indicative of an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism and your medicine needs increasing.

Question:
what does it mean if your tsh is low
Passage 1:
TSH levels in your bloodstream rise or fall depending on whether there is enough thyroid hormone in your system to meet your bodyâs needs. Higher levels of TSH push the thyroid to produce more hormone. Low TSH levels mean the thyroid is producing more than enough hormone. TSH levels can change a great deal with minor increases and decreases in T4. This is a very tightly regulated feedback process between the pituitary and the thyroid gland.
Passage 2:
Low TSH and high FT4 levels are usually seen in people with a condition called hyperthyroidism, the end result of an overactive thyroid gland. Low TSH levels can also indicate that the pituitary gland itself is damaged; however, this is very rare.

Question:
what metal are hip replacements made of
Passage 1:
The implant for a total hip replacement is composed of 3 parts: the stem, the ball, and the socket. The stem is made out of metal, usually cobalt-chrome or titanium, and is placed within the native thighbone. The ball is usually made out of polished metal or ceramic, and fits on top of the stem.
Passage 2:
In the case of dental implants, the answer is actually in many ways- yes. A dental implant is basically a titanium artificial tooth root. It functions as an anchor for a cap, bridge, or denture. Titanium is the strong, bio-compatible metal that artificial knees and hips are made from.

For these properties it is used to make lightweight alloys for aircraft, bikes and laptop computers.The compound Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) absorbs UV light and is used in sunscreen.itanium is resistant to corrosion by sea water and therefore is used on parts of ships. The non-reactive properties of titanium make it ideal for use in the body as hip replacements and pacemakers, which won't be attacked by body fluids.
Passage 2:
Some prosthesis, like hip and knee joints made of cobalt chrome, contain some trace of nickel and for patients with allergies to this may have to go with Titanium joints.

Question:
what metal are hip replacements made of
Passage 1:
In the case of dental implants, the answer is actually in many ways- yes. A dental implant is basically a titanium artificial tooth root. It functions as an anchor for a cap, bridge, or denture. Titanium is the strong, bio-compatible metal that artificial knees and hips are made from.
Passage 2:
A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.

Passage 1:
The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.
Passage 2:

increased airway resistance decreases airway ventilation [Bronchioles are made of smooth muscle, not cartilage, so it can contract or relax, and in asthmatics they contract (due to allergens or exercise) restricting airflow]; alveolar PO2: low arterial PO2: low.
Passage 2:
The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.

Question:
what type of tissue are bronchioles
Passage 1:
3 Respiratory chambers. l Respiratory bronchiole has simple, low columnar or cuboidal bronchiolar and ciliated cells; elastic fibres and smooth muscle support the epithelium's BL. 2 Opening out along the respiratory bronchiole are alveoli, whose openings are ringed by smooth muscle.
Passage 2:
The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.

Each of the terminal bronchioles divides to form respiratory bronchioles which contain a small number of alveoli. Terminal bronchioles are lined with simple cuboidal epithelium containing club cells. Terminal bronchioles contain a limited number of ciliated cells and no goblet cells. Club cells are non-ciliated, rounded protein secreting cells. Their secretions are a nonsticky, proteinaceous compound to maintain the airway in the smallest bronchioles.

what type of tissue are bronchioles
Passage 1:
terÂ·miÂ·nal bronÂ·chiÂ·ole. the end of the nonrespiratory conducting airway; the lining consists of simple columnar or cuboidal epithelium without mucous goblet cells; some of the cells are ciliated; numerous Clara cells also occur.
Passage 2:
They are branches of the bronchi, and are part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system. The bronchioles divide further into smaller terminal bronchioles which are still in the conducting zone and these then divide into the smaller respiratory bronchioles which mark the beginning of the respiratory region. pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.

Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.
Passage 2:
The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.

Question:
what medium do radio waves travel through
Passage 1:
Electromagnetic waves: 1. Electromagnetic (EM) waves (example light waves, radio waves, x-rays etc) can travel through vacuum; they do not require any medium (matter) to travel through and their travel is reduced, to some extent, by the presence of any medium. The common examples of medium are glass, water, air etc.
Passage 2:
Mechanical waves need matter to move. Some examples of electromagnetic waves are Radio, Gamma, X â¦ -rays, Infra-red, and Microwaves Electromagnetic waves are able to travel through a medium of liquids, solids, and geaseous states, or through space where there is no material at all, called vacuum.

Question:
what medium do radio waves travel through
Passage 1:
Mechanical waves require a medium to travel through. Examples of mechanical waves are sound waves, water waves, a vibrating string. (See related link). Electromagnetic waves â¦(such as light, radio waves, X-rays, microwaves) do not need a medium to travel through, so these are not mechanical waves.
Passage 2:
But when the Apollo astronauts were on the moon, where there is no air, or when the Shuttle astronauts need to contact earth through the vacuum of space, radio has to be used because radio waves are electromagnetic waves and can travel easily in a vacuum.

Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little.

These are all types of radiation originating from the electromagnetic force, which is responsible for all electrical and magnetic phenomena. The radiation travels at the speed of light in a manner resembling waves. Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not require a medium through which to move and can travel across empty space.
Passage 2:
No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa â¦ ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space. Let's contrast that with a mechanical wave. A mechanical wave involves the transfer of mechanical energy into and through a medium. Sound waves (which travel through air) and water waves (which move through water) are mechanical waves.

Question:
what medium do radio waves travel through
Passage 1:
Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel. Other examples include water waves, seismic waves, and waves traveling through a spring. Electromagnetic waves are waves that can travel through a vacuum (empty space). They don't need a medium or matter. They travel through electrical and magnetic fields that are generated by charged particles. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light, microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays.
Passage 2:
Mechanical waves require a medium to travel through. Examples of mechanical waves are sound waves, water waves, a vibrating string. (See related link). Electromagnetic waves â¦(such as light, radio waves, X-rays, microwaves) do not need a medium to travel through, so these are not mechanical waves.

Question:
what medium do radio waves travel through
Passage 1:
Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.
Passage 2:
But when the Apollo astronauts were on the moon, where there is no air, or when the Shuttle astronauts need to contact earth through the vacuum of space, radio has to be used because radio waves are electromagnetic waves and can travel easily in a vacuum.

Passage 2:
Electromagnetic waves: 1. Electromagnetic (EM) waves (example light waves, radio waves, x-rays etc) can travel through vacuum; they do not require any medium (matter) to travel through and their travel is reduced, to some extent, by the presence of any medium. The common examples of medium are glass, water, air etc.

S, India. Unlike sound waves or ocean waves, radios waves do not travel in a material. Radio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields. Since they don't require any medium through which to travel, they can go right through empty space.That's why we're able to see the stars, after all.adio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields. Since they don't require any medium through which to travel, they can go right through empty space.
Passage 2:
On the other hand, electromagnetic forms of energy, such as microwaves, radar waves, radio and TV waves, travel millions of miles through the emptiness of space without the need of any material medium through which to travel. This is because, simply put, electromagnetic waves are, in themselves, stored energy in motion.

Passage 2:
Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.

Question:
what medium do radio waves travel through
Passage 1:
Electromagnetic energy is familiar to most people as light and heat, but it can take many other forms, such as radio waves and X-rays. These are all types of radiation originating from the electromagnetic force, which is responsible for all electrical and magnetic phenomena. The radiation travels at the speed of light in a manner resembling waves. Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not require a medium through which to move and can travel across empty space.
Passage 2:
No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa â¦ ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space.

L-carnitine, or just carnitine (the L refers to the configuration of the carnitine molecule that is biologically active) is often referred to as an amino acid, but it is not a true amino acid. Carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that is made in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Its name is derived from the Greek word for flesh or meat, carnus. Not so coincidentally, it's abundant in red meat and dairy products, but it can also be found in various nuts, grains, and green vegetables.

Question:
how does granulation tissue start
Passage 1:
Within hours of the fracture, the blood from the fracture fragments forms a mesh of clotted blood, which is the first link between the two fragments. The mesh contains special cells called Fibroblasts, which begin to lay down tissue called Granulation tissue between 4 and 10 days after the fracture occurs. The Granulation tissue forms a 'scaffold' between the two fragments, from which the formation of a Soft Callus can begin.
Passage 2:
By day 3, the acute inflammatory response is replaced by chronic inflammation (macrophages). Also at 3 days, granulation tissue begins forming, courtesy of growth factors secreted by platelets, macrophages and endothelial cells. Growth factors induce regeneration of the basal cells of the epidermis By day 5, granulation tissue has filled the incisional space. During the second week, collagen accumulates. Leukocytes, edema, and increased vascularity begin to disappear.

Passage 2:
By day 3, the acute inflammatory response is replaced by chronic inflammation (macrophages). Also at 3 days, granulation tissue begins forming, courtesy of growth factors secreted by platelets, macrophages and endothelial cells. Growth factors induce regeneration of the basal cells of the epidermis By day 5, granulation tissue has filled the incisional space. During the second week, collagen accumulates. Leukocytes, edema, and increased vascularity begin to disappear.

how does granulation tissue start
Passage 1:
Within hours of the fracture, the blood from the fracture fragments forms a mesh of clotted blood, which is the first link between the two fragments. The mesh contains special cells called Fibroblasts, which begin to lay down tissue called Granulation tissue between 4 and 10 days after the fracture occurs. The Granulation tissue forms a 'scaffold' between the two fragments, from which the formation of a Soft Callus can begin.
Passage 2:
1 Over the next 3 weeks or so, the body repairs broken blood vessels and new tissue grows. 2  Red blood cells help create collagen, which are tough, white fibers that form the foundation for new tissue. 3  The wound starts to fill in with new tissue, called granulation tissue.  New skin begins to form over this tissue.

Passage 2:
By day 3, the acute inflammatory response is replaced by chronic inflammation (macrophages). Also at 3 days, granulation tissue begins forming, courtesy of growth factors secreted by platelets, macrophages and endothelial cells. Growth factors induce regeneration of the basal cells of the epidermis By day 5, granulation tissue has filled the incisional space. During the second week, collagen accumulates. Leukocytes, edema, and increased vascularity begin to disappear.

Passage 1:
The ancient Egyptian name as transliterated from hieroglyphs is km.t, and was probably pronounced Kemet or Kumat. This means black land, and refers to the fertile black soil around the Nile as distinct from the red sand of the desert. The name is still used today in Coptic - the Copts call themselves rem en khÄmi, People of Egypt. The name Egypt comes from the Greek Aigyptos, and ultimately from the Egyptian Hikuptah.
Passage 2:
Egypt is of the countries in Africa and the Middle East. The ancient name for Egypt is Kemet meaning 'black land'. It had obtained its name owing to the fertile black soil found on the plains of the Nile river which flows through Egypt.fter this period, it continued to be in use as the liturgical language of the Egyptians, Christians, Copts. The Old Egyptian language was spoken for around 500 years from 2600 BC onwards.

Passage 1:
Kemet (keh-MET) is the term ancient Egyptians used as the official name of their country. (Sometimes they also called it Ta-mery, or beloved land.) Kemet translates as Black Land, in reference to the fertile banks and fields surrounding the Nile (black from the soil).he name Kemet is refers to the the Land of the Black people! Some white researchers claim that the name Kemet refers to the rich dark soil that was deposited along the banks if the Nile!
Passage 2:
Quick Answer. The area that is known as Egypt today was called Kemet, which means black or black land, due to the rich black soil left behind after the yearly Nile floods. The word Egypt is actually taken from the word Kemet, but that is not the only name the Ancient Egyptians gave their land. They also called it Gift of the Nile because the only thing not covered by the red sands of the desert was the rich fertile lands along the river itself. Continue Reading

Passage 1:
Nile River and the Desert. In ancient times, the Egyptians called the desert the red land, distinguishing it from the flood plain around the Nile River, called the black land. These colours reflect the fact that the desert sands have a reddish hue and the land around the Nile turned black when the annual flood waters receded.
Passage 2:
1 The people in Ancient Egypt divided Egypt into two areas. 2  The âred landâ was the deserts protecting Egypt on two sides. 3  These deserts separated ancient Egypt from neighbouring countries and invading armies. 4  The black land was the fertile land (near the Nile River) where the ancient Egyptians grew their crops.
