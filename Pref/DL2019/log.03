Question:
axon terminals or synaptic knob definition
Passage 1:
Axons often have thousands of terminal branches, each ending as a bulbous enlargement, the synaptic knob or synaptic terminal. At the synaptic knob, the action potential is converted into a chemical message which, in turn, interacts with the recipient neuron or effector. This process is synaptic transmission.

causes of left ventricular hypertrophy
Passage 1:
Chronic hypertension is the most common cause of diastolic dysfunction and failure. It leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased connective tissue content, both of which decrease cardiac compliance.
Passage 2:
See the Mayo Clinic webpage Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Itâs the thickening of the muscle of the left ventricle, usually because pumping against a higher resistance (hypertension, aortic valve defects) or as part of a hereditary heart muscle disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Itâs correlated with more heart failure, more heart attacks, more deaths.

Question:
causes of left ventricular hypertrophy
Passage 1:
Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor â such as high blood pressure or a heart condition â that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.
Passage 2:
Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor â such as high blood pressure or a heart condition â that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.

Question:
causes of left ventricular hypertrophy
Passage 1:
Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1  High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.  Aortic valve stenosis.
Passage 2:
Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.

Itâs correlated with more heart failure, more heart attacks, more deaths.
Passage 2:
Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a personâs blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.

Question:
causes of left ventricular hypertrophy
Passage 1:
Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor â such as high blood pressure or a heart condition â that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.
Passage 2:
Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.

Question:
causes of left ventricular hypertrophy
Passage 1:
Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.
Passage 2:
Chronic hypertension is the most common cause of diastolic dysfunction and failure. It leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased connective tissue content, both of which decrease cardiac compliance.

Question:
causes of left ventricular hypertrophy
Passage 1:
Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a personâs blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.

The BSN is a degree that you get in a university. It's usually a four year degree. And from there, you can take a state regulated test or the NCLEX.

do goldfish grow
Passage 1:
Goldfish Only Grow to the Size of Their Enclosure. There is an element of truth to this, but it is not as innocent as it sounds and is related more to water quality than tank size. When properly cared for, goldfish will not stop growing. Most fishes are in fact what are known as indeterminate growers.
Passage 2:
They vary in their fin configuration, coloration and in their body size, which is directly influenced by their environment. When they are kept as pets in small fish tanks and aquariums, goldfish tend to stay about 1-2 inches long and never grow larger than 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the DEC. However, in the wild, goldfish often reach 12 to 14 inches (30 to 35 cm) in length.

The cleanliness of your pet's environment, the kinds of food, and your feeding protocols are all factors. Genetics are the predetermined factor in how big your fish will grow. Goldfish sold as tank suitable will grow to about 10 inches while those sold as pond suitable will reach a maximum of about 18 inches.

The common goldfish, so popular on fairgrounds, are among the largest, and they are capable of reaching over 18 inches and 10 pounds. Even the smallest breeds can reach between 4 and 7 inches, making them more suitable for a 20-gallon or larger aquarium than a bowl.

Question:
do goldfish grow
Passage 1:
Goldfish Only Grow to the Size of Their Enclosure. There is an element of truth to this, but it is not as innocent as it sounds and is related more to water quality than tank size. When properly cared for, goldfish will not stop growing. Most fishes are in fact what are known as indeterminate growers.
Passage 2:
The cleanliness of your pet's environment, the kinds of food, and your feeding protocols are all factors. Genetics are the predetermined factor in how big your fish will grow. Goldfish sold as tank suitable will grow to about 10 inches while those sold as pond suitable will reach a maximum of about 18 inches.

Question:
do goldfish grow
Passage 1:
Their size is limited in the tank, but when you release it into the wild, that doesn't exist anymore, Wilson told The Post. Like other species of carp, the domestic goldfish Carassius auratus will basically keep growing as long as water temperatures and food resources support it.
Passage 2:
Small tanks provide poorer water quality than large ones, and will stunt growth in goldfish, often preventing them from reaching their average size of between 8 and 12 inches. But give a goldfish good quality water and lots of space and youâll give him every chance of growing to a good size.

Question:
do goldfish grow
Passage 1:
Goldfish may grow to a maximum length of 23 inches (59 cm) and a maximum weight of 9.9 pounds (4.5 kg), although this is rare; most individual goldfish grow to under half this size. In optimal conditions, goldfish may live more than 20 years (the world record is 49 years); however, most household goldfish generally only live six to eight years.
Passage 2:
This completely depends on the species of fish. Goldfish will live 20-30 years and grow to be a foot long, if you let them. Most die within a few years because people don't look after them well. Fish need bigger tanks as they grow; it is a common misconception that fish only grow to the size of their container.

Question:
does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia
Passage 1:
Other bacteria types that can cause pneumonia include the bacteria that cause so-called atypical pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumonia. The most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults is the influenza virus. A number of different respiratory viruses cause pneumonia in children, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). While viral pneumonia tends to be less severe than bacterial pneumonia, there is a risk of developing secondary bacterial pneumonia when viral pneumonia is present.

Question:
does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia
Passage 1:
Legionellosis, or Legionnaire's disease, is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Legionnaires' disease is not contagious, and you cannot catch it from another person. The bacteria are common and grow in water.
Passage 2:
1 The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is a type of bacteria known as Streptococcus pneumoniae. 2  Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are some other major bacteria that cause pneumonia. The body's immune system usually keeps bacteria from infecting the lungs. 2  In bacterial pneumonia, bacteria reproduce in the lungs, while the body tries to fight off the infection. 3  This response to bacterial invaders is called inflammation.

does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia
Passage 1:
What Is Legionnaires' Disease. Legionnairesâ disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila. In fact, L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of infections.The disease typically presents as pneumonia and symptoms may include a high fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, headaches, and diarrhea.bout the Disease. Legionnaires' disease is a severe, often lethal, form of pneumonia. It's caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila found in both potable and nonpotable water systems.
Passage 2:
Atypical pneumonia refers to pneumonia caused by certain bacteria, including Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. It is called âatypicalâ because the symptoms differ from those of pneumonia due to other common bacteria. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung.ack to Top Symptoms. Pneumonia due to mycoplasma and chlamydophila bacteria is usually mild. 1  Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila gets worse during the first 4 - 6 days, and then improves over 4 - 5 days.

Question:
does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia
Passage 1:
Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a serious form of pneumonia called Legionnaires disease. Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia. legionella infection affects the lower respiratory tract, often requires hospitalization, and has a significant mortality rate. In addition to pneumonia, Legionella bacteria can also cause Pontiac fever, a milder and self-limiting illness with flu-like symptoms.
Passage 2:
1 Atypical pneumonia is caused by bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae.  Other bacteria that can cause pneumonia include Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.

Question:
does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia
Passage 1:
Legionnaires disease (LD) is the pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. LD also refers to a more benign, self-limited, acute febrile illness known as Pontiac fever, which has been linked serologically to L pneumophila, although it presents without pneumonia. (See Pathophysiology and Etiology.)
Passage 2:
What Is Legionnaires' Disease. Legionnairesâ disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila. In fact, L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of infections. The disease typically presents as pneumonia and symptoms may include a high fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, headaches, and diarrhea.

Passage 1:
Other bacteria types that can cause pneumonia include the bacteria that cause so-called atypical pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumonia. The most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults is the influenza virus. A number of different respiratory viruses cause pneumonia in children, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). While viral pneumonia tends to be less severe than bacterial pneumonia, there is a risk of developing secondary bacterial pneumonia when viral pneumonia is present.

Question:
does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia
Passage 1:
What Is Legionnaires' Disease. Legionnairesâ disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila. In fact, L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of infections. The disease typically presents as pneumonia and symptoms may include a high fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, headaches, and diarrhea.
Passage 2:
Other bacteria types that can cause pneumonia include the bacteria that cause so-called atypical pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumonia. The most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults is the influenza virus. A number of different respiratory viruses cause pneumonia in children, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). While viral pneumonia tends to be less severe than bacterial pneumonia, there is a risk of developing secondary bacterial pneumonia when viral pneumonia is present.

exons definition biology
Passage 1:
Genes contain exons which are regions coding for proteins and which are interrupted by the unused sequences called introns. Exons have been found to include both sequences coding for amino acids and untranslated sequences. The introns are removed and the exons are joined together to form the final functional mRNA.
Passage 2:
An exon is any part of a gene that will encode a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.

Passage 1:
The human genome consists of 3 billion nucleotides or âlettersâ of DNA. But only a small percentage â 1.5 percent â of those letters are actually translated into proteins, the functional players in the body. The âexomeâ consists of all the genomeâs exons, which are the coding portions of genes. The term exon was derived from âEXpressed regiON,â since these are the regions that get translated, or expressed as proteins, as opposed to the intron, or âINTRagenic regiONâ which is not represented in the final protein.

Passage 1:
Instead of a deletion of DNA sequence that characterized the earlier disease discovery, the new condition is caused by a substitution of DNA in an exon of the gene. Exons are sub-parts of DNA sequence within a gene that carry the code for proteins. The alternate DNA sequence modifies the function of the enzyme.
Passage 2:
The human genome consists of 3 billion nucleotides or âlettersâ of DNA. But only a small percentage â 1.5 percent â of those letters are actually translated into proteins, the functional players in the body. The âexomeâ consists of all the genomeâs exons, which are the coding portions of genes. The term exon was derived from âEXpressed regiON,â since these are the regions that get translated, or expressed as proteins, as opposed to the intron, or âINTRagenic regiONâ which is not represented in the final protein.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
When you initiated treatment, it can be assumed that eggs were laid earlier that day. It takes around 2 days for those eggs to hatch, 7 days for the larvae to pupate, and another 7 days until the adult stage is reached. In homes, you can expect the full life cycle to complete in 17 to 26 days. While no new fleas should be able to successfully develop past 26 days, one life stage is a problem.
Passage 2:
1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months.  Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.

It takes around 2 days for those eggs to hatch, 7 days for the larvae to pupate, and another 7 days until the adult stage is reached. In homes, you can expect the full life cycle to complete in 17 to 26 days. While no new fleas should be able to successfully develop past 26 days, one life stage is a problem.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The so-called âsand-fleaâ is nothing more than a common flea that is breeding outdoors in the soil. Contrary to belief, fleas cannot go through several generations without having a blood meal. The entire life cycle (Figure 5) of a flea can require two weeks to two years. Hot, wet, summer months favor egg laying.
Passage 2:
The time it takes to complete the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months, depending on the temperature, humidity and the amount of food available. A typical flea population consists of 50 per cent eggs, 35 per cent larvae, ten per cent pupae and only five per cent adults.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.
Passage 2:
Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70Â° and 90Â° Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more. Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating.

In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.n a humid environment, over 60% of newly hatched fleas can live without a host for 2 months. In a cool, dry environment, only 10% will live without an immediate host. Humidity is the key to flea survival.
Passage 2:
Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment. An adult flea can live up to two weeks without a host. Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day.
Passage 2:
Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.
Passage 2:
1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages.  made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. 1  Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.n a humid environment, over 60% of newly hatched fleas can live without a host for 2 months. In a cool, dry environment, only 10% will live without an immediate host. Humidity is the key to flea survival.
Passage 2:
There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).

It takes around 2 days for those eggs to hatch, 7 days for the larvae to pupate, and another 7 days until the adult stage is reached. In homes, you can expect the full life cycle to complete in 17 to 26 days. While no new fleas should be able to successfully develop past 26 days, one life stage is a problem.
Passage 2:
6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.
Passage 2:
There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day.
Passage 2:
The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).
Passage 2:
The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.

Passage 1:
Fleas: advice and information. Fleas: advice and information Flea facts One flea will lay up to 25 eggs per day (approximately 800 in its life) Fleas develop from egg to larvae to pupae to adults in 18-26 days (depending on temperature) Fleas can only lay eggs after taking blood from the host animal they are living on. Approximately 90-95% of the fleas are cat fleas.
Passage 2:
Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
When you initiated treatment, it can be assumed that eggs were laid earlier that day. It takes around 2 days for those eggs to hatch, 7 days for the larvae to pupate, and another 7 days until the adult stage is reached. In homes, you can expect the full life cycle to complete in 17 to 26 days. While no new fleas should be able to successfully develop past 26 days, one life stage is a problem.
Passage 2:
The flea population is typically. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider. One of the most important things is life cycle of the flea, which depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels can take between a couple of week to many months. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Here we will discuss all fourâ¦.
Passage 2:
Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.
Passage 2:
The cat fleaâs life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat fleaâs life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 Â½ months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
When you initiated treatment, it can be assumed that eggs were laid earlier that day. It takes around 2 days for those eggs to hatch, 7 days for the larvae to pupate, and another 7 days until the adult stage is reached. In homes, you can expect the full life cycle to complete in 17 to 26 days. While no new fleas should be able to successfully develop past 26 days, one life stage is a problem.
Passage 2:
1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. 2  Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.

6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.n a humid environment, over 60% of newly hatched fleas can live without a host for 2 months. In a cool, dry environment, only 10% will live without an immediate host. Humidity is the key to flea survival.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The time it takes to complete the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months, depending on the temperature, humidity and the amount of food available. A typical flea population consists of 50 per cent eggs, 35 per cent larvae, ten per cent pupae and only five per cent adults.
Passage 2:
When you initiated treatment, it can be assumed that eggs were laid earlier that day. It takes around 2 days for those eggs to hatch, 7 days for the larvae to pupate, and another 7 days until the adult stage is reached. In homes, you can expect the full life cycle to complete in 17 to 26 days. While no new fleas should be able to successfully develop past 26 days, one life stage is a problem.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.
Passage 2:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.

Question:
how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid
Passage 1:
The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid, The midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two bimedians (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas). The height (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance between the bases.
Passage 2:
The midsegment of a trapezoid is referred to as the median or the midline. The length of the midsegment is calculated by finding the average length of each of the parallel sides. The formula for this length is the sum of the length of side A plus the length of side B, divided by two. The midsegment is also used to calculate the area of a trapezoid. Learn more about Shapes.

Passage 2:
A trapezoid midsegment connects the midpoints of the two congruent sides of the trapezoid, and is parallel to the pair of parallel sides. The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.

Passage 1:
Medical Definition of Mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation: Use of a machine called a ventilator or respirator to improve the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere. Last Editorial Review: 5/13/2016.
Passage 2:
Mechanical ventilation is the use of a mechanical device (machine) to inflate and deflate the lungs. Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.

Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.

Question:
medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation
Passage 1:
A ventilator delivers gas to the lungs with either negative or positive pressure. It must be understood that no mode of mechanical ventilation can or will cure a disease process but merely supports the patient until resolution of his/ her symptoms is accomplished.
Passage 2:
Mechanical ventilation. Assisted ventilation could be defined as the movement of gas into and out of lungs by an external source connected directly to the patient. The external source could be the resuscitation bag, continuous distending pressure device or a mechanical ventilator.

Question:
right pelvic pain causes
Passage 1:
If it was located in lower right side it could be appendix or kidney stones. On left lower side it could be kidney stones, and on upper side it could be acidity. Gas in abdomen can cause cramping pain. In females it can be an ovarian cyst. Hence, finding the cause is important. Acidity and gas can be treated by taking omeprazole and antacids.
Passage 2:
1 Appendicitis: Inflammation of the appendix that is attached to the large intestine, and located in the lower right side of the abdomen. Usually, an inflamed appendix must be removed by surgery.  Cholecystitis: Inflammation of the gallbladder, causing severe right-sided abdominal pain.

What is RSA? RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication; it was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman [RSA78]. It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq ; n is called the modulus.
Passage 2:
RSA (algorithm) RSA is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of them can be given to everyone. The other key must be kept private.

Question:
rsa definition key
Passage 1:
RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted in a reasonable amount of time using the private key.n such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.
Passage 2:
Definition - What does RSA Encryption mean? RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.

Question:
types of dysarthria from 19335 palsy
Passage 1:
The term dysarthria encompasses a group of motor speech disorders caused by a disturbance in the neuromuscular control of speech. These disorders result from central or peripheral nervous system damage and are manifested as weakness, slowness, or incoordination of speech.
Passage 2:
The key point is that dysarthria is a symptom, and diagnosis of the cause is essential. It may be due to a disorder of the brain (such as following a stroke) or nerve supply to the muscles of speech, which involve the face, the tongue, or the muscles of the throat. There are several types of dysarthria.

what types of food can you cook sous vide
Passage 1:
All kinds! Any type of meatâsuch as beef, pork, lamb, game, or poultryâis ideal for sous vide. It works especially well with fish and seafood, ensuring that these delicate foods are not overcooked. Almost any vegetable can also be cooked sous vide with delicious results, as can eggs and many fruits. You can even use it to make custard-style ice cream base, bÃ©arnaise sauce, crÃ¨me Anglaise, custards, cheese, yogurt, and even cakes.
Passage 2:
What is a Sous Vide Cooker? We said it before and weâll say it again: a sous vide machine is a better way to cook. When you use a sous vide at home, youâll be cooking with water. Itâs not at all what youâre thinking. Your steak and chicken â any food really â will be placed in BPA-free, sturdy plastic bags and cooked.

Passage 2:

Question:
define visceral?
Passage 1:
Best Answer: It has two meanings. It can mean relating to the internal organs of your body (the visceral organs), or it can mean relating to deep emotional feelings that are separate from intellect. Visceral means, roughly, in the guts. The viscera are your internal organs. The word is Latin. So, if you have a visceral feeling, it means a feeling on the inside, in your internal organs; and usually this is referring to the guts (intestines). For instance, you have a gut feeling, something you feel inside you.
Passage 2:
Visceral: Referring to the viscera, the internal organs of the body, specifically those within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas or intestines). In a figurative sense, something visceral is felt deep down.. It is a gut feeling..

Best Answer: It has two meanings. It can mean relating to the internal organs of your body (the visceral organs), or it can mean relating to deep emotional feelings that are separate from intellect. Visceral means, roughly, in the guts. The viscera are your internal organs. The word is Latin. So, if you have a visceral feeling, it means a feeling on the inside, in your internal organs; and usually this is referring to the guts (intestines). For instance, you have a gut feeling, something you feel inside you.

what is physical description of spruce
Passage 1:
The leaves of conifers are of course their needles. On true pine trees, the needles are arranged and attached to the branches in clusters of two (red pine group), three (yellow pine group), or five (white pine group) needles per cluster. Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.

A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea /paÉªËsiËÉ/, a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal regions of the Earth. Spruces are large trees, from about 20â60 m tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruces are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small, peg-like structure. The needles are shed when ...
Passage 2:
spruce. 1  1a : any of a genus (Picea) of evergreen trees of the pine family with a conical head of dense foliage, flat or 4-sided needles, pendulous cones, and soft light woodb : any of several coniferous trees (as Douglas fir) of similar habit. 2  2 : the wood of a spruce.

Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.

Question:
what is physical description of spruce
Passage 1:
Like fir trees, spruces have single needles connected to the stems. However, spruce tree needles are sharp and square-shaped. On a real tree, spruce needles easily break apart if you bend them. As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches.

The needles often curve inward and measure about three quarters of an inch long.
Passage 2:
1. (Plants) any coniferous tree of the N temperate genus Picea, cultivated for timber and for ornament: family Pinaceae. They grow in a pyramidal shape and have needle-like leaves and light-coloured wood. See also Norway spruce, blue spruce, white spruce, black spruce. 2. (Forestry) the wood of any of these trees.

Question:
what is physical description of spruce
Passage 1:
The leaves of conifers are of course their needles. On true pine trees, the needles are arranged and attached to the branches in clusters of two (red pine group), three (yellow pine group), or five (white pine group) needles per cluster. Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.
Passage 2:
Spruces are large trees, from about 20â60 m (about 60â200 ft) tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small, peg-like structure.

Question:
what is physical description of spruce
Passage 1:
Spruces are large trees, from about 20â60 m (about 60â200 ft) tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small, peg-like structure.
Passage 2:
Like fir trees, spruces have single needles connected to the stems. However, spruce tree needles are sharp and square-shaped. On a real tree, spruce needles easily break apart if you bend them. As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches.

As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches.
Passage 2:
The leaves of conifers are of course their needles. On true pine trees, the needles are arranged and attached to the branches in clusters of two (red pine group), three (yellow pine group), or five (white pine group) needles per cluster. Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.

Question:
what is a active margin
Passage 1:
Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.

Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.

Question:
what is a active margin
Passage 1:
Best Answer: An active margin is a tectonic plate boundary, a passive margin is a compositional transition within a tectonic plate. As you probably know the theory of plate tectonics posits the outer layer of the Earth consist of plates which move relative to each other driven by convection in the Mantle.
Passage 2:
The location where two plates meet is called a plate boundary. Plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features such as mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, and oceanic trenches. Convergent boundaries (Destructive) (or active margins) occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision.

Question:
what is a active margin
Passage 1:
An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.
Passage 2:
Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.

Question:
what is a active margin
Passage 1:
Cases of continental margins that are on or very close to a plate margin. Most continental margins around the Pacific are active. Key characteristics of active continental margins include the activity of volcanoes and earthquakes, narrow continental shelves, large coastal mountains, and much more.
Passage 2:
Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.

Question:
what is a active margin
Passage 1:
The location where two plates meet is called a plate boundary. Plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features such as mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, and oceanic trenches. Convergent boundaries (Destructive) (or active margins) occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision.
Passage 2:
The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America.

Question:
what is a active margin
Passage 1:
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.
Passage 2:
Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.
