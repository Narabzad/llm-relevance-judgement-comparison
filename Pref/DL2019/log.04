Question:
axon terminals or synaptic knob definition
Passage 1:
Axons usually have thousands of terminal branches that each end as a bulbous enlargement called a synaptic knob or synaptic terminal. Synaptic knobs contain several membrane-bounded synaptic vesicles that are 40 to 100 nanometers in diameter.
Passage 2:
Button-like endings of axons through which axons make synaptic contacts with other nerve cells or with effector cells Supplement Axon terminals refer to the axon endings that are somewhat enlarged and often club- or button-shaped. Axon terminals are that part of a nerve cell that make synaptic connections with another nerve cell or with an effector cell (e.g. muscle cell or gland cell). Axon terminals contain various neurotransmitters and release them at the synapse.

Question:
axon terminals or synaptic knob definition
Passage 1:
An axon terminal is the structure of a neuron (a single cell of the central or peripheral nervous system) at the end of it's axon that forms a synapse with another neuron. Generally, the axon terminal is the point at which a neuron passes information to the neurons with which it is connected.
Passage 2:
Axons usually have thousands of terminal branches that each end as a bulbous enlargement called a synaptic knob or synaptic terminal. Synaptic knobs contain several membrane-bounded synaptic vesicles that are 40 to 100 nanometers in diameter.

Passage 1:
1 Common, comet, shunbunkin, and some fancy goldfish can grow to be over 12 inches (30.5 cm) long if put in tanks or ponds that are large enough! 2  However, contrary to popular belief, fish do not stay the size of their tank.
Passage 2:
Goldfish Only Grow to the Size of Their Enclosure. There is an element of truth to this, but it is not as innocent as it sounds and is related more to water quality than tank size. When properly cared for, goldfish will not stop growing.

Question:
do goldfish grow
Passage 1:
This completely depends on the species of fish. Goldfish will live 20-30 years and grow to be a foot long, if you let them. Most die within a few years because people don't look after them well. Fish need bigger tanks as they grow; it is a common misconception that fish only grow to the size of their container.
Passage 2:
If kept in a suitable environment, single tail goldfish normally grow to 10 inches (25cm) and can sometimes reach 12 inches (30cm). Fancy goldfish normally grow to 8 inches (20cm). The normal life expectancy of a single tail goldfish is about 20 years.

Passage 2:
They vary in their fin configuration, coloration and in their body size, which is directly influenced by their environment. When they are kept as pets in small fish tanks and aquariums, goldfish tend to stay about 1-2 inches long and never grow larger than 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the DEC. However, in the wild, goldfish often reach 12 to 14 inches (30 to 35 cm) in length.

Question:
does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia
Passage 1:
Background. Legionnaires disease (LD) is the pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. LD also refers to a more benign, self-limited, acute febrile illness known as Pontiac fever, which has been linked serologically to L pneumophila, although it presents without pneumonia.
Passage 2:
Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a serious form of pneumonia called Legionnaires disease. Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia. legionella infection affects the lower respiratory tract, often requires hospitalization, and has a significant mortality rate. In addition to pneumonia, Legionella bacteria can also cause Pontiac fever, a milder and self-limiting illness with flu-like symptoms.

Question:
does legionella pneumophila cause pneumonia
Passage 1:
Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia. It is caused by bacteria called Legionella pneumophila. The bacteria got its name in 1976, when a group of people attending an American Legion convention became infected.ymptoms can range from mild to severe. Pontiac fever symptoms include fever and muscle aches. Symptoms usually appear 1 to 2 days after a person is exposed to the bacteria.
Passage 2:
What Is Legionnaires' Disease. Legionnairesâ disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila. In fact, L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of infections. The disease typically presents as pneumonia and symptoms may include a high fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, headaches, and diarrhea.

Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia. legionella infection affects the lower respiratory tract, often requires hospitalization, and has a significant mortality rate. In addition to pneumonia, Legionella bacteria can also cause Pontiac fever, a milder and self-limiting illness with flu-like symptoms.
Passage 2:
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a type of bacteria, is the most common cause of pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila is the bacterial type that causes the pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease.

Exons are expressing sequences within a pre-mRNA molecule that are spliced together once introns are removed to form mature mRNA molecules that are translated into proteins. Alternative splicing allows for the production of various protein isoforms from one single gene coding.
Passage 2:
An exon is any part of a gene that codes for a part of the final mature RNA product of that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing.The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.he term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The cat fleaâs life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat fleaâs life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 Â½ months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.
Passage 2:

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.
Passage 2:
1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages.  made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. 1  Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).
Passage 2:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.

There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).
Passage 2:
1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. 2  Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.  Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.
Passage 2:
30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.

Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.
Passage 2:
The time it takes to complete the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months, depending on the temperature, humidity and the amount of food available. A typical flea population consists of 50 per cent eggs, 35 per cent larvae, ten per cent pupae and only five per cent adults.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The total flea life cycle can range from a couple weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. ADULT: The adult flea is very flat side to side. There are hair-like bristles on the flea body and legs to aid in their navigation through pet hair.
Passage 2:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85Â°F and 70 percent humidity.
Passage 2:
30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.
Passage 2:
Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70Â° and 90Â° Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more. Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating.

The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.

Question:
how long is life cycle of flea
Passage 1:
The cat fleaâs life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat fleaâs life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 Â½ months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.
Passage 2:
Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.

what is physical description of spruce
Passage 1:
Spruces are large trees, from about 20â60 metres (about 60â200 feet) tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small peg-like structure called a pulvinus.
Passage 2:
A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea /paÉªËsiËÉ/, a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal regions of the Earth. Spruces are large trees, from about 20â60 m tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form.

Question:
what is physical description of spruce
Passage 1:
Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.

Question:
what is a active margin
Passage 1:
Active continental margin: A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope that ends in a deep trench instead of a continental rise; it is marked by earthquake and volcanic activity.
Passage 2:
The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.
