2607750	Bone marrow (stem cell) transplants have been used for the treatment and cure of a variety of. cancers, immune system diseases, and blood diseases for many years. Doctors in the United States and other countries have developed studies to treat children who have. severe sickle cell disease with bone marrow (stem cell) transplants. How does a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant work? In a person with sickle cell disease, the bone marrow produces red blood cells that contain hemoglobin S. This leads to the complications of sickle cell disease. â  To prepare for a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant, strong medicines, called chemotherapy, are used to weaken or destroy the patientâs own bone marrow, stem cells, and infection ï¬ ghting. system. â This is done so the patient does not reject the new blood cells coming from the donor.
2607751	That depends on whether youâre getting a peripheral blood stem cell transplant or a bone marrow transplant for cancer treatment. Peripheral blood stem cells. In this approach, the stem cells circulating in the donorâs blood are harvested and stored.
2607752	The purpose of a stem cell transplant or a bone marrow transplant is to replenish the body with healthy cells and bone marrow when chemotherapy and radiation are finished. After a successful transplant, the bone marrow will start to produce new blood cells. In some cases, the transplant can have an added benefit; the new blood cells will also attack and destroy any cancer cells that survived the initial treatment.
2607753	Stem cells for a transplant -- whether from peripheral blood cells or bone marrow -- can come from two places: your body or a matching donorâs body. Autologous transplants involve stem cells taken from your body before youâve received chemotherapy and radiation.

2607756	Bone marrow (stem cell) transplant is the only treatment available today that can cure sickle cell disease. If the transplant is successful, the patient is cured from sickle cell disease.
2607757	â  The patientâs bone marrow then is replaced with blood-forming stem cells from a donor who. does not have sickle cell disease. â This can be a donor with normal hemoglobin or sickle cell trait. â The actual transplant is given like a blood transfusion through an IV tube.
2607758	Doctors also treat some blood diseases with stem cell transplants.In the past, patients who needed a stem cell transplant received a âbone marrow transplantâ because the stem cells were collected from the bone marrow. Today, stem cells are usually collected from the blood, instead of the bone marrow. For this reason, they are now more commonly called stem cell transplants. Why are bone marrow and stem cells important? A part of your bones called âbone marrowâ makes blood cells. Marrow is the soft, spongy tissue inside bones.

8367842	The patient receives high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, followed by the stem cell transplant. A donor's stem cells are then transfused into the patient's blood. The transplanted stem cells go from the patient's blood to his or her marrow.
8367843	A transplant replaces the abnormal stem cells in the patient's bone marrow with healthy stem cells from a donor. The donor's cells also replace the patient's immune system, which can prevent the growth or proliferation of any remaining CML cells. Several variables come into play.
8379150	Autologous stem cell transplants. These stem cells come from you alone. In this type of transplant, your stem cells are taken before you get cancer treatment that destroys them. Your stem cells are removed, or harvested, from either your bone marrow or your blood and then frozen.

98383	Stem cells for a transplant -- whether from peripheral blood cells or bone marrow -- can come from two places: your body or a matching donorâs body.Autologous transplants involve stem cells taken from your body before youâve received chemotherapy and radiation.tem cells can also come from what is known as a matched unrelated donor (MUD). Your bone marrow and tissue typing is matched against an unknown donor via a bone marrow registry to find a compatible donor. Doctors will search bone marrow registries if the patient does not have a relative who âmatchesâ their stem cells.
985264	Diseases. As bone marrow affects many body systems, a problem can result in a wide range of diseases, including cancers that affect the blood. A number of diseases pose a threat to bone marrow because they prevent bone marrow from turning stem cells into essential cells.
