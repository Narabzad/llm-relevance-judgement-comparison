# Compatibility
This directory contains the scripts to compute compatibility vs. NDCG@10 which is used to measure agreement with system rankings across all types of relevance judgments.

The compatibility measure is decribed in various papers, with an implementation at: https://github.com/claclark/Compatibility

The implemenation from that repo is included in this directory.

The experiments are fully scripted. To understand everything, start with `everything.sh`.
